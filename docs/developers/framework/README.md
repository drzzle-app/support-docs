# Picazzo

The websites that are generated by Drzzle use a custom built front end framework (similar to bootstrap or material) called "Picazzo", which was specifically made for this application. We plan on making Picazzo open source in the near future, however for the time being we will share basic utilities and classes you can use to build elements via the "General Code" droplet.

## Grid System
Picazzo contains a standard responsive 12 column grid system. See below for usage:
```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="column col-4">
    Some content here.
  </div>
  <div class="column col-4">
    Some content here.
  </div>
  <div class="column col-4">
    Some content here.
  </div>
</div>
```
