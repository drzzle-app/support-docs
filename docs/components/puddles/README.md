# Puddles

## Filtering
In the droplets tab at the bottom of the page editor, you can filter just puddle type droplets.

## Droplets allowed
Not every droplet is allowed to be dropped inside puddles. In that same note, other puddles cannot currently be dropped inside puddles. To see what droplets are allowed to be dropped inside a puddle, you can open the droplet options and click on the purple "See Allowed Droplets" button. This will open the bottom droplets tab and filter those out for you.
