# Content Blocks

## Filtering
In the droplets tab at the bottom of the page editor, you can filter just content block type droplets.

## Allowed Targets
Unlike standard droplets, which are limited to being dropped in sections and _some_ puddles, content blocks can be dropped and rearranged outside of sections.
