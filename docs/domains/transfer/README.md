# Transferring Domains

## Contact Information
By default, if you purchase a domain through our application, the registrant contact information is our information, however we
can change this to your contact information for you at your wish. Here is what that looks like:
```

Contact Type: COMPANY
Country: US
Email: admin@drzzle.com
First Name: Drzzle

## Requesting a Transfer
If you wish to transfer your domain to another registrar, you will need to contact a support representative to do so at
```support@drzzle.com```. There is no charge for this.
