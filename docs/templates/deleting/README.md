# Deleting Templates

There are two places where you can delete a template. Both methods  are done in the top control bar of the site editor. We will cover more on those below. Another thing to note is that you cannot delete a template if it is in use by one or more pages.

## From Search Modal
You can delete a template from the search modal just as long as you see a solid trash can on that templates's row. If you see a trash can that is somewhat transparent, it is because the template cannot be deleted. To see the reason the template cannot be deleted, you can hover over the trash can and it should give you that information.

## From Template Settings
The other place that you can delete a template is on the settings modal of the template you are editing.
