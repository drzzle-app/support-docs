## Public URL
Your site's public url is a URL automatically generated when your site is first made. It is a URL that should be publicly accessible to anyone unlike the site editor preview URL.

## Google Analytics
In this settings page, you can enter your Google Analytics ID if you have one. This will embed the GA script in each page of your website.
