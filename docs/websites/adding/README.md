After this, you should launch right into the site's settings view. From there you can edit basic global settings and you can also launch the drag and drop site editor.

## Publishing

After a new website is first created, it can take up to 10 minutes for it to be live on the web. Once it's ready, the default "construction" page will be shown.

In order to publish your pages, you will need to launch into the site editor, open the save modal in the top control bar and hit "Save & Publish Page".
