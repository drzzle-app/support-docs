# Overview

All account owners have the option to add additional sub-users under their account. The owner can pick
and choose what website's to give these sub-users edit permissions to. They work great for delegating content
editing to other people.

When a sub-user logs in, they will only see the website's the owner has allowed them to edit. They will also have
limited permissions for those website's. They will not be able to purchase anything for their website's, add new
ones or delete them. They should only be allowed to edit _content_.
