# Concept

We thought it was worth mentioning that Drzzle doesn't quite have a concept of themes. Our droplets and sections are customizable enough where users can build their look and feel as they go. We purposely built things this way in an effort to have a more flexible way of building websites.

Sections and _most_ droplets have a style tab in it's edit bubble where you can change the color scheme of them. Below are a few examples of this in action.
