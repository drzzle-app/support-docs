# Overview

We thought it was worth mentioning that Drzzle doesn't quite have a concept of themes. Our droplets and sections are customizable enough that users can build their look and feel as they go. We purposely built things this way in an effort to have a more flexible way of building websites.

All droplets have style options where you can alter things like color scheme, positioning, padding, borders, shadows etc. Below are a few examples of this in action.

## Boilerplates

In terms of pre-built layouts and pages, our boilerplates exist for this purpose. Which is to create tailored websites as a starting point for users. Each boilerplate has been designed and built by professional designers using user experience and visual design best practices but users can change them up and break them if they wish.
