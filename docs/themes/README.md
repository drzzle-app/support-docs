# Overview

We thought it was worth mentioning that Drzzle doesn't quite have a concept of themes. Our droplets and sections are customizable enough that users can build their look and feel as they go. We purposely built things this way in an effort to have a more flexible way of building websites.

Sections and _most_ droplets have a "style" tab in it's edit bubble where you can change the color scheme of them. Below are a few examples of this in action.

## Boilerplates

In terms of pre-built layouts and pages, our boilerplates exist for this purpose. Which is to create tailored websites as a starting point for users to add content when creating new websites. Boilerplates should not be confused with themes, however, because that is not exactly what they are. Each boilerplate has been designed and built by professional designers using user experience and visual design best practices but users can change them up and break them if they wish.
